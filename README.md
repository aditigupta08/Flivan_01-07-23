Creating a Landing Page using HTML and CSS
Welcome to the simple guide on creating an effective landing page! This project focuses on using the core web technologies: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). HTML provides the basic structure for our landing page, allowing us to define elements such as headers, paragraphs, links, and images. On the other hand, CSS offers the power to style these elements, giving our page a unique and attractive appearance.

Steps to get started:

HTML Structure: Begin by creating an index.html file. Define the basic structure, including the <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. Within the <body> tag, structure your content with semantic HTML5 elements like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer>.

CSS Styling: Create a styles.css file. Use this file to define your colors, typography, layout, and other design elements. Make sure to link this stylesheet in the index.html file with a <link> tag inside the <head>.

Responsive Design: Ensure your landing page looks great on all devices. Use media queries in your CSS to adapt the layout, font sizes, and other elements for different screen widths.

Preview and Test: Open your index.html in a web browser to preview the landing page. Test on various devices and browsers to ensure compatibility.

Feel free to extend this basic setup with additional functionalities or integrate with frameworks or libraries of your choice. Happy coding!

This is just a basic introduction and can be expanded upon based on the exact requirements or features needed for the landing page.
